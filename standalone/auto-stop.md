# Auto Stop
---
Sometimes, you'll want to response people by your self. GigaAI has built in feature for that. When you chat with a person, Bot will automatically stop the conversation between her and the person which you're talking to.

- To tell Bot return to the conversation, just send a blank message. Bot now back to auto response.

- To stop this feature and let bot always chat with people, even when you're chatting with, go to `/config.php`, and set `auto_stop` to `false`.
