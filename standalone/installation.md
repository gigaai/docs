### Secure Tunnels to Localhost
Let's assume that you want to test your bots in your development environment before deploying. You'll need to let Facebook connect to your PC and it should have SSL enabled. To simply these steps, we'd recommend that you use [ngrok](https://ngrok.com), it will automatically create a secure public URL to your local webserver with format: `https://RANDOM.ngrok.io`.
