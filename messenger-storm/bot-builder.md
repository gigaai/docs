## Responding People Actions

To response to each people action, we can create a node for related action. This part show you how to do it with Bot Builder.

- In `When` drop down, select an action.
    - If you select `Text`, you'll see a Content text box. Which allows you define what message content to response.
    - If you select `Click`, you'll see a dropdown which allows you select what button which people click to response.
    
- In `Bot answer with` drop down, select a [message type](message-types) to response. Note that `Receipt` is not available for Bot Designer since it requires dynamic data.
