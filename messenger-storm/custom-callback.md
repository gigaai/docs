In the [Dynamic Data](dynamic-data) guide. We've used callback to avoid caching feature. 
Giga also brings a fluent way to handle postback by using custom callback, this make the plugin becomes the ultimate weapon for you, for real.

## Custom Callback
Instead of only using supported [Message Types](message-types). You can also use custom callback function to do anything you want. For example, if people click "Get Weather" button, you'll need to handle that event and send them a message by get weather from database and send back to them. Let's see this example:

```
// When people clicked GET_WEATHER. We handle it here

$bot->answer('payload:GET_WEATHER', function ($bot, $lead_id) 
{
	// Free to do your jobs here. These lines below are pseudo code
	$user_location  = $bot->storage->get($lead_id, 'location');
	$weather        = \Weather::ofLocation($user_location)->get();
	
	// Response user via return
	return "Your weather today is {$weather}";
});
```

## Callback Arguments

In the above example, you can see we've used `$bot` and `$lead_id` arguments. There're totally 3 arguments: `$bot`, `$lead_id`, and `$input`. All of them are optional.

`$bot` is the `GigaAI\MessengerBot` instance

`$lead_id` is the current user id

`$input` is the user sent message
