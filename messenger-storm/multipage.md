# Multipage
---
Since 2.3, Giga AI has new Multipage feature which lets you manage unlimited pages at one place. Think it like Multisite in WordPress.

You can create one node for all pages, you can create a subscription channel and send notification for a particular page or all pages, you can also manage all leads from different pages, all in one dashboard.

### To enable Multipage, you'll need to:

- Using Premium Editions (Personal 365, Business 365)
- Setup your bot successfully (connection success), we'll use the first page as master page, some settings of new pages will inherit from it.
- Go to *Settings/Multipage* and check *Multipage*

That's it, you'll see the collapse menu which helps you manage pages.

### To add new Page
- Click on the collapse menu and click *Create New Page* or go to: https://your-domain.com/wp-admin/admin.php?page=giga&_action=create

- Follow the [Setup Messenger](/docs/wordpress/setup-messenger) guide to create new page like normally.
