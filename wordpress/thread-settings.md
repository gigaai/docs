## Persistent Menu
The Persistent Menu is a menu that is always available to the user. This menu should contain top-level actions that users can enact at any point. Having a persistent menu easily communicates the basic capabilities of your bot for first-time and returning users.
The menu can be invoked by a user, by tapping on the 3-caret icon on the left of the composer.
