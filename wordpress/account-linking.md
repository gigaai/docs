## Sending Login Button
To send Login Button, you can create any button of type `account_link`. The button can be in buttons group, carousel, or list.

## Sending Logout Button
To send Logout Button, you can create any button of type `account_unlink`. The button can be in buttons group, carousel, or list.

## Check if Lead is Logged in
By default, the `linked_account` field of lead is set to `NULL`, after logged in, it set to the current user id in `wp_users` table. You can use Storage API to check:

```
$bot->storage->get($lead_id, 'linked_account');
```
